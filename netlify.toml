  # Rule 1: Redirect old Netlify subdomain to the canonical domain (For SEO migration)

# REWRITE RULES (For clean URLs and functionality)

  # Rule 4: HTML File Cleanup (For "pretty URLs" like /about instead of /about.html)
  # FIX: Changed from 301 redirect to 200 rewrite to prevent redirect loops.
  from = "/*.html"
  to = "/:splat"
  status = 200 # <-- Changed from 301 to 200
  # force = true # <-- 'force' is not strictly needed for 200 rewrites, but harmless

  # Rule 5: SUCCESS PAGE REWRITE (Internal rewrite for clean form submission URL)
  from = "/success"
  to = "/components/success.html"
  status = 200

  # Rule 6: SEO File Cleanup (Serve robots.txt and sitemap.xml directly)
  from = "/robots.txt"
  to = "/robots.txt"
  status = 200

  from = "/sitemap.xml"
