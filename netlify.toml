# REWRITE RULES (Modified for "Ugly" Single/Album URLs)
# =========================================================================

  # EXCLUSION: If the path is /single or /album exactly, do NOT rewrite to .html.
  # This forces the server to look for a folder instead of the file, making /single 404
  # and requiring /single.html
