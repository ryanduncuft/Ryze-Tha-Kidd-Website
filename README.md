# Ryze Tha Kidd Official Platform

This is the source code for my official website. I built this platform to serve as the central hub for my music releases, project updates, and my journey as an artist. My main goal is to keep the site fast, modern, and easy to navigate on any device.

### Tech Stack

I’ve built the site using modern web standards to keep things lightweight and maintainable.

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
* **Framework:** Bootstrap 5 (I recently migrated from Tailwind CSS for better consistency and a cleaner structure).
* **Data Handling:** I use JavaScript to parse JSON data, which allows me to render my discography dynamically without duplicating code.
* **Deployment:** Hosted and automated through Netlify.
* **Version Control:** Managed with Git and hosted here on GitHub.

### Core Features

* **Dynamic Discography:** A full catalog of my music with custom sorting options for date, title, or artist.
* **Responsive UI:** The entire interface is optimized for a seamless experience whether you're on a phone, tablet, or desktop.
* **Theme Customization:** I’ve integrated a Light and Dark mode toggle that works across the whole site.
* **Community FAQ:** A dedicated space where I answer the most common questions I get from my community.

### Version History

**v3.0 - The Evolution (Current)**
This was a complete ground-up reconstruction. I moved the design system over to Bootstrap 5, added the Dark Mode toggle, and launched the new community FAQ section.

**v2.1.5 - Performance Overhaul**
I focused heavily on speed and fixing mobile "jank." I implemented deferred script loading, CSS preloading, and lazy-loading for heavy elements like YouTube iframes to make the site feel much snappier.

**v1.1.5 - Dynamic Architecture**
This was a major technical shift where I moved from static HTML files to a data-driven model. I created single and album templates that pull content dynamically, which makes the site much easier for me to update.
